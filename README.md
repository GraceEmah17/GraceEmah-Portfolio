Projects

This week challenge was for me to create a portfolio project on a bio webpage about myself. I created this using html for the structure of the portfolio web page and css to style it. 
Ensuring the page looks like the mockup for the for challenge which was given, including the images and sizes.

[Project - Horiseon-code-refactor2]
git@github.com:GraceEmah17/Horiseon-code-refactor-project2.git

This project was about a marketing company that wanted to make their webpage better by ensuring site is optimized for search engines. This was achieved by making sure i gave the it an identity for it to be clickable. A short discription of all images were added to using an alt atribte to it. 
The technologies used for this project was html and css to style the page. 

Skills
I have demostrated my skills for this portfolio by using wireframe for the layout of the page. Ensuring the pictures are the correct sizes as the mockup, and the site is optimized for the search engine and beautified the page with my css, ensuring the right colors are used, such as font colors, background colors, sizes etc.
